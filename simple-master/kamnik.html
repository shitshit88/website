            <h1>Chateau Kamnik winery </h1>
            <p>It all started as a very personal fascination with the wine-making art that the founder, 
a wine enthusiast from Skopje, has always had; everything else came as a completely 
natural nowadays expression of the authentic Macedonian wine-making traditions.
From collecting wines from all over the globe, through the first vines planted and their 
transformation into vineyards, through the foundations of the boutique winery 
resembling a castle, and the first barriques in it, to the first wines bottled, and then 
many more travelling around the world, some winning great awards, this man shared 
his vision with a team of excellent people, and turned it into a quest called Kamnik 
Wines, our creations combining past and future, now; keeping our story alive.
